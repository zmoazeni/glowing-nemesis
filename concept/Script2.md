## Lettini Lying on the Boat

Our hero, Lettini, letting his mind drift off, not unlike the boat he's upon, slips into a summertime slumber...

## Docks. Being shocked by Blanka

L: AAAAHHHH!

## Docks. Facing Blanka

L: What? Where am I?

###

Narrative: Lettini looks at his surroundings, realizing he's been here a million times before. His headband...his robe...

###

B: Now you remember.

L: Who are you?

B: Your subconcious? Your insanity? Does it matter?

###

L: What? So I'm supposed to fight?

B: Fight? No. You are here to SING! That is, if you want to taste another delicious Gusher™ ever again!"



## Battle 1: Docks. Sagat (Lionel Richie: Hello)

Narrative: Lettini's Subconscious disappears and a bald kickboxer lithely struts over. Lettini tenses ready to attack.

###

Sagat: ♬ I've been alone with you inside my mind... ♬

###

L: This is weird, but I'm not going to turn into a lunatic in my own dreams.

L: ♬ Hello. Is it me you're looking for? ♬



## Battle 2: Subway. Zangief (Irene Cara: What a feeling)

Narrative: Lettini deftly dispatches the kickboxer with his mellow tones. Colors swirl and he is transported to the subway. In front of him, an angry wrestler flexes his muscles and growls.

###

Zangief: ♬ First when there's nothing, but a slow glowing dream. That your fear seems to hide. Deep inside your mind... ♬

L: You gotta be kidding me.

###

L: ♬ What a feeling. I am music now. Being's believing. I am rhythm now... ♬



## Battle 3: Air Force. Guile (Kenny Loggins: Highway to the Danger Zone)

Narrative: Colors swirl again and then come into focus on an Air Force base. Facing Lettini is a meticulously dressed soldier that has obviously spent too much time on his hair and his tan.

###

Guile: ♬ Revvin' up your engine. Listen to her howlin' roar. Metal under tension. Beggin' you to touch and go ♬

L: Typical.

###

L: ♬ Highway to the Danger Zone. I'm gonna take you right into the Danger Zone... ♬



## Battle 4: Vegas. Balrog.

Narrative: Colors swirl once more to bring Lettini to the Las Vegas strip. The Boxer in facing him doesn't give him any time to orient himself before launching into the song.

###

Balrog: ♬ Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Caught in a landslide, No escape from reality. ♬

###

Narrative: Lettini's confidence drops as he realizes he won't be able to hit the high register.

L: Uh oh.


## Battle 4 - Hurt: Vegas. Balrog hands up, Lettini on the ground

Narrative: The Boxer crushes Lettini in the bout.


## Battle 4 - Lettini's 2nd shot: Vegas. Balrog and Lettini facing each other

Narrative: Lettini stands up and brushes himself off. The crowd watches him in anticipation and he realizes he gets to choose the song this time.

### (Haim: Forever)

L: ♬ Hey you! Remember me? Remember love? Remember trying to stay together? ... ♬

L: ♬ It isn't fair, to have your way. To try and get up and go and na na na na now can't you see... ♬


## Battle 4 - Hadouken

L: ♬ Hey you! Hey you! Can't you make this sane?... ♬


## Battle 4 - Turn away

L: ♬ Forever we try, forever we try. ♬


## End. Vegas. Blanka (Facing each other)

Narrative: The Boxer disolves and Lettini's Subscious returns.

###

L: I am done. Take me out of here.

Blanka: Very well.


## End. Vegas. Blanka electrifiying Lettini

Blanka: ...But you have only begun your journey.


## Very End. Top gun photoshop

The End??
